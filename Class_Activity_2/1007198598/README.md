# Class Activity 2 - Implementation Report

## Overview
This report details the implementation of data cleanup functionality and automatic PDF report generation for the integration testing system, as requested in the Class Activity 2 instructions.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Data Cleanup Implementation

#### Backend Changes

**UsersService.py - Added DELETE endpoint:**
- **New endpoint:** `DELETE /users/<int:user_id>`
- **Functionality:** Deletes a user by ID with proper error handling
- **Database operations:** Uses SQLAlchemy session management with rollback on errors
- **Response codes:** 200 for success, 404 for user not found, 500 for server errors

**TaskInstance.py - Added DELETE endpoint:**
- **New endpoint:** `DELETE /tasks/<int:task_id>`
- **Functionality:** Deletes a task by ID with proper error handling
- **Database operations:** Uses SQLAlchemy session management with rollback on errors
- **Response codes:** 200 for success, 404 for task not found, 500 for server errors

**BackEndTest.py - Enhanced with cleanup functionality:**
- **Global tracking:** Added `created_users` and `created_tasks` lists to track test data
- **New functions:**
  - `delete_user(user_id)`: Calls DELETE API endpoint for users
  - `delete_task(task_id)`: Calls DELETE API endpoint for tasks
  - `verify_data_deletion()`: Verifies all test data was properly deleted
  - `cleanup_test_data()`: Orchestrates the complete cleanup process
- **Enhanced test flow:** Test execution followed by automatic cleanup and verification

#### Frontend Changes

**FrontEndTest.py - Enhanced with cleanup functionality:**
- **Global tracking:** Added `created_users` and `created_tasks` lists to track test data created through UI
- **New functions:**
  - `delete_user_via_api(user_id)`: Makes direct API calls to delete users
  - `delete_task_via_api(task_id)`: Makes direct API calls to delete tasks
  - `verify_data_deletion()`: Verifies deletion by querying APIs
  - `cleanup_test_data()`: Complete cleanup orchestration
- **ID extraction:** Enhanced to extract and track IDs from UI responses for cleanup
- **Enhanced test flow:** UI testing followed by API-based cleanup and verification

### 2. Automatic PDF Report Generation

#### Backend Report Generation

**BackEndTest.py - PDF reporting features:**
- **Sequential numbering:** `get_next_report_number()` function ensures no report overwrites
- **Report directory:** Creates `test_reports/` directory automatically
- **File naming:** Pattern: `backend_test_report_001.pdf`, `backend_test_report_002.pdf`, etc.
- **Report content includes:**
  - Test execution timestamp
  - Overall test status (PASSED/FAILED)
  - Data cleanup status (SUCCESS/FAILED)
  - Detailed execution log
  - Summary of created test data
- **Library used:** ReportLab for PDF generation

#### Frontend Report Generation

**FrontEndTest.py - PDF reporting features:**
- **Sequential numbering:** Independent numbering from backend reports
- **File naming:** Pattern: `frontend_test_report_001.pdf`, `frontend_test_report_002.pdf`, etc.
- **Report content includes:**
  - Test execution timestamp
  - UI test status (PASSED/FAILED)
  - Data cleanup status (SUCCESS/FAILED)
  - Detailed execution log including UI interactions
  - Summary of created test data

## Code Sections Added

### 1. Backend Test Enhancements (BackEndTest.py)

**Global Variables (Lines 12-16):**
```python
# Global variables to track created data for cleanup
created_users = []
created_tasks = []
test_results = []
```

**Data Tracking (Lines 18-40):**
- Modified `create_user()` and `create_task()` functions to append IDs to tracking lists
- Added logging to `test_results` list for report generation

**Cleanup Functions (Lines 62-140):**
- `delete_user(user_id)` - API call to delete user
- `delete_task(task_id)` - API call to delete task
- `verify_data_deletion()` - Verification of cleanup
- `cleanup_test_data()` - Main cleanup orchestration

**PDF Generation (Lines 142-210):**
- `get_next_report_number()` - Sequential numbering logic
- `generate_pdf_report()` - Complete PDF generation with ReportLab

**Enhanced Main Function (Lines 212-250):**
- Added exception handling with finally block
- Integrated cleanup and reporting into test flow

### 2. Frontend Test Enhancements (FrontEndTest.py)

**Global Variables (Lines 13-17):**
```python
# Global variables to track created data for cleanup
created_users = []
created_tasks = []
test_results = []
```

**Enhanced UI Functions (Lines 23-80):**
- Modified existing functions to extract and track created IDs
- Added detailed logging for all UI interactions

**API Cleanup Functions (Lines 82-160):**
- `delete_user_via_api(user_id)` - Direct API deletion calls
- `delete_task_via_api(task_id)` - Direct API deletion calls
- `verify_data_deletion()` - API-based verification
- `cleanup_test_data()` - Complete cleanup process

**PDF Generation (Lines 162-230):**
- `get_next_report_number()` - Frontend-specific sequential numbering
- `generate_pdf_report()` - Frontend test report generation

**Enhanced Main Function (Lines 232-275):**
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Integrated cleanup and reporting into test execution flow

### 3. Service Enhancements

**UsersService.py - DELETE Endpoint (Lines 35-48):**
```python
@service_a.route('/users/<int:user_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_user(user_id):
    # Implementation with proper error handling and database operations
```

**TaskInstance.py - DELETE Endpoint (Lines 35-48):**
```python
@service_b.route('/tasks/<int:task_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_task(task_id):
    # Implementation with proper error handling and database operations
```

## Dependencies Added

**requirements.txt:**
- `reportlab==4.0.4` - For PDF generation functionality
- All existing dependencies maintained for compatibility

## Usage Instructions

### Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running Tests

**Backend Test:**
```bash
python BackEndTest.py
```

**Frontend Test:**
```bash
python FrontEndTest.py
```

### Expected Outputs

1. **Console logs:** Detailed execution information with cleanup status
2. **PDF reports:** Generated in `test_reports/` directory with sequential numbering
3. **Database verification:** All test data properly cleaned up after execution

## Key Features Implemented

✅ **Complete data cleanup** - All test data is deleted after execution
✅ **Cleanup verification** - System verifies data was properly deleted
✅ **Sequential PDF reports** - No overwrites, all reports preserved
✅ **Error handling** - Comprehensive error handling for all operations
✅ **API integration** - Frontend tests use API calls for cleanup
✅ **Detailed logging** - All operations logged for report generation
✅ **Database safety** - Proper transaction management with rollbacks

## Test Execution Flow

1. **Test execution** (create users and tasks)
2. **Data tracking** (record all created IDs)
3. **Test verification** (validate functionality)
4. **Cleanup execution** (delete all test data)
5. **Cleanup verification** (confirm deletion)
6. **Report generation** (create PDF with results)
7. **Final status** (success/failure summary)

This implementation ensures that no test data remains in the system after test execution while providing comprehensive reporting of all test activities.
