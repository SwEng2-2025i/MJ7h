# Lab 1, Multichannel Notification System

### David Fernando Adames Rondon

## System Explanation

This project implements a REST API system to send multichannel notifications using the Chain of Responsibility and Singleton design patterns. Users can register with available communication channels (email, SMS, console) and set a preferred channel. Notifications are sent using the preferred channel first; if it fails, the system falls back to the next available channels.

- `201 Created`: User successfully registered

}
```

## ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Design Patterns Used

### 1. Chain of Responsibility
- Each notification channel implements a `ChannelHandler`.
- A chain is built with the preferred channel at the front.
- If it fails, the next channel in the chain is called.

### 2. Singleton
- The `NotificationLogger` follows the Singleton pattern to ensure a single point of logging for attempts.
